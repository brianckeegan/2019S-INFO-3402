    "Often the data you are interested in is spread across multiple web pages. In an ideal world, the naming conventions would let you retrieve the data from these pages systematically. In the case of the Oscars, the URLs appear to be consistently formatted: `https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2019` suggests that we could change the 2019 to any other date going back to the start of the Oscars and get that year as well: `https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2018` should get us the page for 2018, and so on. Let's demonstrate each of these strategies with the Oscars data: iterating from 2019 back to 1929 in the URL versus parsing the list of links from the header.\n",

We can also incorporate the `sleep` functionality and wait a second between each `print` statement—it should now take 10 seconds for this code to finish printing.
