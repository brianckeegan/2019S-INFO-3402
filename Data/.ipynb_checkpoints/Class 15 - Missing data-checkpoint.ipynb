This is because the multiple regression model subtracted 3.2 years from a passenger's estimated age for every sibling or spouse they were traveling with. If someone was traveling with many siblings, this could potentially cause the model to estimate them as having a negative age. In this case, the model found the [Sage family](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/the-sage-family-of-peterborough.html) of 11 all traveled on the same ticket and none of them survived."
